excerpt: Git, a distributed versioning system powers developers across domain, technology
  around the world.
---
<p>Software development process would never be complete without a versioning system in place, Source code being written in various languages across framework/platform by multiple developers and the pain part comes in the way of versioning it.Software being distributed in public need to be versioned for better tracking and maintenance.a proper versioning system helps to scale the project with transient development team.</p>
<p><strong>What is Git ?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)" target="_blank">Git</a>, A distributed source control versioning system used today by most of the development teams to develop high quality software maintaining multiple version with teams across globe working on different time zone and as being said distributed a repository will be available in each developer machine which would be synced (Push/Pull)</p>
<p><b>Why Git ?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Git is a proven solution to maintain code base</li>
<li>Git is efficient in its core to maintain projects at any magnitude</li>
<li>Integrated natively/thru extension in top-notch IDEs
<ul>
<li>Android Studio</li>
<li>Visual Studio</li>
<li>XCode</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Supported across OS ( Mac, Linux, Windows)</li>
<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration" target="_blank">Continuous Integration</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Understand Git</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Git maintains a <strong>.git</strong> folder to keep track of the <strong>changes (diff/patch) alone</strong> instead of holding the entire file</li>
<li>Change set is the snapshot of the code base at any point of time</li>
<li>Git tracks file based on the changes made against the <strong>HEAD</strong> version</li>
<li>HEAD in git is the latest available committed change set</li>
<li>Master is a trunk wherever your code changes are tracked by default</li>
<li>Supports <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/" target="_blank">branches</a> for non-linear development</li>
<li><em>.<strong>gitconfig</strong></em> - maintains configuration of single git repository or globally across your system</li>
<li><em>.<strong>gitignore</strong></em> - helps to ignore the files which might be specific to IDE/User/Common library</li>
<li>Supports staging/un-staging of files</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When Git ?</strong></p>
<p>Git is an anonymous solution when u are considering of maintaining your source code, it could be a simple class work, college project or a successful application in the market.</p>
<p><strong>Commands</strong></p>
<p>Git is packed with tons and tons of commands but an understanding few should work for you most of the time.</p>
<p>A great start would be reading this <a href="https://services.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf">cheat sheet</a> from <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The object-oriented model makes it easy to build up programs by accretion. What this often means, in practice, is that it provides a structured way to write spaghetti code.</p>
<p>- Paul Graham</p></blockquote>
<p>Happy Coding !!</p>
